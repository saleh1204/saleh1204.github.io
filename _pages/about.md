<p style='text-align: justify;'> I, Saleh AlSaleh, received my B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in computer science and my M.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), in 2016 and 2019, respectively. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Computer Science and Engineering Department, Penn State University in Computer Architecture and Reconfigurable Computing. I have taught multiple courses at KFUPM including digital design lab, computer architecture lab, embedded systems lab, and introduction to programming in Python and C. I held the position of teaching assistant for CMPEN 431 introduction to computer architecture in Fall 2024 @ Penn State University. My research interests include digital design, FPGA, embedded systems, in-storage computation, and computer architecture. </p>
